    Sensors::
        Environment/Obstacle Sensor:
            General safety as well as no camera.
        Camera:
            Adds storage of map data only viewable after uplink. (Limited Storage?)
        Comms: 
            Transmits data 25 squares away (1/2 = Rainy Day, 1/4 = Lightning)
        Geology: 
            allows identifying of high-yeild metal deposits
        Engineering: 
            Allows manipulating of high energy containers
       
     Tools::
        Excavtor/Mine:
            Allows to mine materials out of rock (surface only. no underground mining?)
        
        Arm:
            picks up objects (standard)
        
        factory arm:
            allows picking up other heavy equipment (eg: other robot parts)
        
        Manipulator:
            heals other robots/picks up sensative objects (datalogs)
            healing: 
                if only manipulator:
                    heal robot slowly from 75% health and up
                if reprap factory:
                    heal robot from 25% health and up
        
    Side::
            Storage Container:
                Holds 25 extra tons (robot by default holds 5)
            Extra Power Pack: 
                Holds 150 extra power (robot by default holds 50)
            
    Back::
        Person Courier:
            TT#X! Class Sentient Being (human//20%oxy,nitrogen,glucose,water)
        Smelter: 
            Refines 10 tons ore into 1 ton metal
        RepRap Part Factory:  
            Consumes 5 energy 2 metal to heal friendly robot if you have manipulator

Metallics:::
    Scrap Metal:
        15-20 metal
    Raw Ore:
        10-20 metal
    Salvage:
        25-50% of origninal robot
    Processed metal: 
        25-50 metal

Energetics:::
    Solar Array:
        5 energy/day
    Fuel Cell:
        10-20 energy-0decay
    Power Cell:
        25-50 energy 2decay/day
    Small Fusion Reactor:
        25 energy/day
    Salvage:
        0-25% of orignal power unit
